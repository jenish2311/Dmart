This is just an Exercise.  


Assignment 1
- An Image container shows an image which will load via image link (server url) .
- Image Container should resize itself depending on the image ratio in terms of height .
- Image Container width will be fixed as per the device width.
- Height can vary to match the image ratio .
- Image should not Stretch / Squeeze / distort nor it should get cut in terms of height and width .
- We will be testing multiple different size images with image url(server url).


                                


Assignment 2
- One single scrolling page 
- Use 3 Components 
   -- Image (Assignment 1 can be reused)
   -- Grid Container
   -- List Container .
- All these will be in array format .
- Each Component can have multiple values .
- Each can come multiple times and randomly sequenced .
- Grid will have 2/3/4 columns and 'n' rows depending on the data.
- You need to Create a json structure for the same to fetch and display on the screen.
- The json will decide how many components will be there and in what sequence .
- Static data such as (image url , name, value , description) will be part of the same json structure itself . 
- The rendering of the page will be from the json file which will be stored in the project itself .
- The Testing will be done by adding / deleting / updating the components and the data values of the component.
